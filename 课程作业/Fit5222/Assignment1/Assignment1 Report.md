**Student_Name**: \[RuiLongZhang\]  
**Student_ID**: \[35851147\]

### **Abstract**

This report details the design and implementation of pathfinding algorithms for the three tasks of the FIT5222 Flatland Challenge. As the problem difficulty progresses from single-agent pathfinding (Question 1), to single-agent planning with dynamic obstacles (Question 2), and finally to a fully dynamic multi-agent pathfinding problem with malfunctions and delay penalties (Question 3), this report adopts a progressively evolving algorithmic strategy. Starting with the fundamental A\* algorithm, advancing to **Prioritized Planning** for handling multi-agent interactions, the final solution culminates in a **robust prioritized planning framework featuring a multi-stage fallback mechanism and a circuit breaker** to address performance bottlenecks in extremely complex scenarios. The report will provide a detailed description of the implementation details and algorithmic analysis of each method, and will use numerical experiment results to validate the effective balance achieved by the final solution among completion rate, on-time arrival rate, and computational efficiency.

### **1. Introduction**

The core problem of the Flatland Challenge is Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF), which involves planning collision-free paths from start to goal locations for multiple agents (trains) within a shared, constrained railway network. This problem is a classic challenge in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics, with wide-ranging applications in warehouse automation, traffic control, and network routing. Its primary difficulty lies in the exponential growth of the potential conflict state space as the number of agents increases.
This assignment is divided into three sections of increasing difficulty:
- **Question 1**: A fundamental single-agent pathfinding task, aimed at establishing an understanding of the Flatland environment and implementing a basic search algorithm.
- **Question 2**: Introduces dynamic obstacles, requiring the algorithm to plan a path for a single agent within a partially occupied space-time environment. This serves as a critical transition towards multi-agent problems.
- **Question 3**: A complete and dynamic MAPF problem that demands the simultaneous planning for all agents, while also handling random runtime malfunctions and delay penalties. This poses a comprehensive challenge to the algorithm's **coordination, efficiency, robustness, and optimization capabilities**.
This report will sequentially present the algorithmic strategies adopted for each question. A key focus will be on detailing the series of iterative optimizations performed in Question 3 to overcome the inherent weaknesses of simple prioritized planning, culminating in a hybrid strategy designed to maximize the competition score under strict time and memory constraints.

### **2. Question 1: Warm-up - Basic Pathfinding**

#### **2.1 Description of Approach**
**2.1.1 Algorithm Selection**
For Question 1, the task is to find the shortest path for a single agent from a start to a goal location within a static railway network, free of obstacles and time dimensions. This is a classic graph search problem. Based on the concepts learned in the course and the performance guarantees of the algorithm, I chose the **A* search algorithm**.

The reasons for selecting A* are as follows:
- **Optimality Guarantee**: A* guarantees finding the lowest-cost path under specific conditions (i.e., using an admissible heuristic). For Question 1, where the evaluation is based on path cost, ensuring optimality is the primary objective.
- **Efficiency**: Compared to non-heuristic algorithms like Dijkstra's, A* uses a heuristic function to guide the search direction, significantly reducing the number of nodes that need to be explored. This makes it more efficient than blind search algorithms in most cases.
- **Maturity and Versatility**: A* is one of the most fundamental and widely used algorithms in the field of pathfinding, with a clear implementation and ease of debugging.
    
**2.1.2 Implementation Details**

My A* implementation is built around several core components:
- **State Representation**: In the Flatland environment, an agent's possible moves from a location depend on the direction from which it entered that location. Therefore, a complete state cannot be represented merely by (row, col) coordinates but must be a triplet of (row, col, direction). This ensures that the successor function can correctly query the rail transition rules.
- **Data Structures**:
    - **OPEN List**: I implemented a priority queue (min-heap) using Python's heapq module to store nodes to be explored. Each element in the queue is a tuple (f_score, g_score, state), which is automatically sorted by f_score, with g_score serving as a tie-breaker.
    - **g_score Dictionary**: Used to store the lowest known cost (g-value) from the start to each visited state. This is crucial for avoiding redundant explorations and for updating paths with better alternatives. The key is the state (row, col, direction), and the value is the cost.
    - **came_from Dictionary**: Used to backtrack and reconstruct the full path after the goal is found. The key is the current state, and the value is its predecessor state.
- **Successor Function**: This is the core of the algorithm's interaction with the Flatland environment.
    1. For the current state (row, col, dir), call rail.get_transitions(row, col, dir).
    2. This function returns a 4-element boolean array, indicating which of the four cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) are valid transitions from the current direction.
    3. Iterate through all valid turns and use get_new_position() to calculate the coordinates and direction of the successor state.
    4. The cost of each valid move is incremented by 1.
    5. 
- **Heuristic Function**:
    - I adopted the **Manhattan Distance** as the heuristic function h(n). The formula is:  
        h = |current_pos.row - goal_pos.row| + |current_pos.col - goal_pos.col|
    - **Reasoning**: In a grid map where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical steps, the Manhattan distance represents the shortest possible path length from the current point to the goal, ignoring any obstacles. Therefore, it never overestimates the actual remaining cost, making it an **admissible** heuristic, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for guaranteeing A*'s optimality.

**2.1.3 Pseudo-code**

```python
function A_Star_Search(start_pos, start_dir, goal_pos, rail):
    start_state = (start_pos, start_dir)
    open_set = PriorityQueue()
    push(open_set, (0 + heuristic(start_pos, goal_pos), 0, start_state))
    
    g_score = map with default value infinity
    g_score[start_state] = 0
    
    came_from = empty map

    while open_set is not empty:
        current_g, current_state = pop(open_set)
        current_pos, current_dir = current_state
        if current_pos == goal_pos:
            return reconstruct_path(came_from, current_state)
            
        for each valid neighbor_state of current_state:
            tentative_g_score = current_g + 1
            if tentative_g_score < g_score[neighbor_state]:
                g_score[neighbor_state] = tentative_g_score
                f_score = tentative_g_score + heuristic(neighbor_state.pos, goal_pos)
                came_from[neighbor_state] = current_state
                push(open_set, (f_score, tentative_g_score, neighbor_state))

    return failure // or empty list
```

#### **2.2 Algorithmic Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**:
    - The time complexity of the A* algorithm is primarily determined by the operations on the priority queue. In the worst-case scenario, it may need to explore nearly all states in the graph.
    - Each state is pushed into the priority queue at most once. The time complexity for both push and pop operations is O(log N), where N is the number of nodes in the OPEN list.
    - Therefore, the total time complexity is **O(|S| log |S|)**, where |S| is the size of the state space (map_width * map_height * 4 directions). In practice, performance is often much better than the worst case due to the guidance provided by the heuristic.
        
- **Space Complexity**:
    - The algorithm needs to store the open_set, g_score, and came_from data structures. In the worst case, these structures may need to store all states.
    - Thus, the space complexity is **O(|S|)**.
        
- **Completeness**:
    - **Yes**. As long as a path exists from the start to the goal and all edge costs are positive (in this case, 1), the A* algorithm is guaranteed to find a path.
        
- **Optimality**:
    - **Yes**. Because the Manhattan distance heuristic I used is **admissible** (i.e., it never overestimates the actual cost to the goal), the A* algorithm is guaranteed to find the lowest-cost (i.e., shortest) path.
        

#### **2.3 Reflections**

- **Advantages**:
    1. **Guaranteed Optimality**: For Question 1, where the core evaluation metric is cost, A* ensures that I achieve the minimum cost score for every instance, which is its greatest advantage.
    2. **Reliable Efficiency**: Compared to BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm, the heuristic guidance of A* makes it highly efficient, especially on large, sparse maps.
    3. **Straightforward Implementation**: The algorithm's logic is classic and clear, making it easy to implement and debug, and providing a solid foundation for the more complex problems that follow.
        
- **Disadvantages**:
    1. **Not Applicable to Multi-Agent Scenarios**: This implementation does not consider the presence of other agents and cannot be directly applied to Questions 2 and 3.
    2. **Memory Consumption**: While not an issue for the scale of instances in Question 1, in much larger state spaces, A*'s need to store g_score and came_from information for all visited nodes could present memory challenges.
    3. **Necessity of State Representation**: Neglecting to include direction in the state representation would prevent the algorithm from making correct decisions at junctions, which is a common implementation pitfall.
        

#### **2.4 Numerical Experiments**
My A* implementation successfully found paths in all provided single_test_case instances. As this is a foundational problem and the algorithm guarantees optimality, its performance is mainly reflected in runtime and the number of expanded nodes. The experimental data shows that for the instance sizes in Question 1, the algorithm completes almost instantaneously. The number of expanded nodes also shows a reasonable positive correlation with map complexity and the distance between the start and goal, validating the correctness and efficiency of the algorithm.

### **3. Question 2: Easy Mode - Avoiding Dynamic Obstacles**

#### **3.1 Description of Approach**

**3.1.1 Algorithm Selection**

The core challenge of Question 2 is to plan a collision-free path for a single agent within an environment containing dynamic obstacles (i.e., the predetermined paths of other agents). This scenario is a simplified version of the Multi-Agent Pathfinding problem, where the evaluation server constructs a global solution by **sequentially** invoking the planning function. This model perfectly aligns with the concept of **Prioritized Planning**.

Therefore, I chose to upgrade the A* algorithm from Question 1 into a **Time-Aware A***, to serve as the low-level path planner within the prioritized planning framework.

**Reasoning**:

- **Directly Addresses the Core Challenge**: Prioritized planning is a classic and effective method for solving such sequential MAPF problems. It decomposes the complex, coupled multi-agent problem into a series of single-agent planning problems with evolving space-time constraints, significantly reducing complexity.
    
- **Guarantees Single-Agent Optimality**: Under the given constraints (the paths of higher-priority agents), Time-Aware A* is capable of finding the lowest-cost (i.e., earliest arrival time) collision-free path for the current agent.
    
- **Scalability**: This approach lays a solid foundation for the more complex global planning and replanning challenges presented in Question 3.
    

**3.1.2 Implementation Details**

To adapt the standard A* algorithm to an environment with space-time constraints, I implemented the following key modifications:

- **State Representation**: The state was expanded from (row, col, direction) to (row, col, direction, time). Time t becomes a core dimension of the state, as the availability of a physical location differs at different points in time.
    
- **Space-Time Reservation Table**:
    
    - Before planning for each agent, I iterate through existing_paths (i.e., the paths of all higher-priority agents).
        
    - I construct a hash set, reservation, containing all occupied space-time units to enable collision checking with O(1) complexity.
        
    - The reservation table stores not only **vertex conflicts** (x, y, t) but also **swapping conflicts (head-on collisions)**. A swapping conflict is represented as a tuple (x_after, y_after, t, x_before, y_before), signifying that a move from before to after at time t is forbidden.
        
- **g_score Dictionary Optimization (Critical Optimization)**:
    
    - This was the most critical technical detail of this implementation. To correctly handle situations where an agent must **wait** for multiple steps at a location to avoid an obstacle, the key for the g_score dictionary (which records arrival costs) **must be the complete space-time state** (row, col, direction, time).
        
    - If the key did not include time, the algorithm would incorrectly assume that once a (pos, dir) combination is visited at a cost t, it could not be revisited at a higher cost (e.g., t+1, which represents waiting one step). This would prune necessary waiting actions, leading to failed searches or suboptimal solutions. This optimization is the fundamental guarantee for the algorithm's high success rate and the quality of the paths found.
        
- **Successor Function**:
    
    - The successor function now explores all valid **move** and **wait** actions.
        
    - For each generated successor state (new_pos, new_dir, new_time), it performs a strict collision check against the reservation table for both vertex and swapping conflicts. Only conflict-free successor nodes are added to the OPEN list.

**3.1.3Pseudo-code**
```Python
function Prioritized_Planning_Agent(start, goal, rail, existing_paths, max_timestep):

    reservation = build_reservation_table(existing_paths)


    return Time_Aware_A_Star(start, goal, rail, reservation, max_timestep)

function Time_Aware_A_Star(start, goal, rail, reservation, max_timestep):

    start_state = (start.pos, start.dir, 0) // state: (pos, dir, time)
    open_set = PriorityQueue()
    push(open_set, (heuristic(start.pos, goal), 0, start_state))
    
    g_score = map with default value infinity
    g_score[start_state] = 0 // Key is (pos, dir, time)
    came_from = empty map


    while open_set is not empty:
        current_g, current_state = pop(open_set)
        
        if current_state.pos == goal:
            return reconstruct_path(came_from, current_state)


        for each valid neighbor_state from current_state:
            if is_colliding(neighbor_state, reservation):
                continue

            tentative_g_score = current_g + 1
            if tentative_g_score < g_score[neighbor_state]:
                g_score[neighbor_state] = tentative_g_score
                f_score = tentative_g_score + heuristic(neighbor_state.pos, goal)
                came_from[neighbor_state] = current_state
                push(open_set, (f_score, tentative_g_score, neighbor_state))
                
    return failure
```

#### **3.2 Algorithmic Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: For a single agent's plan, the time complexity is O(|S'| log |S'|), where |S'| is the size of the space-time state space, approximately equal to map_width * map_height * 4 * max_timestep. Since the server invokes the planner sequentially, the total time is the sum of all individual planning times.
    
- **Space Complexity**: O(|S'|), primarily determined by the g_score and came_from dictionaries.
    
- **Completeness**: **Incomplete**. The prioritized planning algorithm itself is incomplete. A low-priority agent can be completely blocked by higher-priority agents, causing the algorithm to fail to find a solution even if a global one exists. However, in the context of Question 2 where agents are added one by one, this issue is significantly mitigated.
    
- **Optimality**: **Not optimal**. The algorithm only guarantees finding the optimal path for each agent under its own set of constraints. The "selfish" choices of high-priority agents can lead to a total path cost (SIC) for the global solution that is far from optimal.
    

#### **3.3 Reflections**

- **Advantages**:
    
    1. **Efficient and Effective**: The prioritized planning concept is highly suitable for the sequential evaluation model of Question 2. It decomposes a difficult MAPF problem, making it tractable.
        
    2. **Clear Implementation**: The core of the algorithm is a constrained A*, making the logic clear and easy to extend from the Question 1 implementation.
        
    3. **Excellent Performance**: Thanks to the critical optimization of the g_score logic, the algorithm demonstrated an extremely high success rate and produced high-quality paths in experiments, proving its effectiveness.
        
- **Disadvantages**:
    
    1. **Theoretical Limitations**: The algorithm's incompleteness and non-optimality are inherent theoretical flaws. These weaknesses become more apparent in more congested and tightly coupled scenarios (like in Question 3).
        
    2. **Sensitivity to Priority**: The performance is highly dependent on the agent planning order chosen by the evaluation server. A poor ordering could lead to a significant drop in performance.
        
    3. **Memory Consumption**: The g_score and came_from dictionaries store the complete space-time state, which could lead to memory pressure in scenarios with a very large max_timestep.
        

#### **3.4 Numerical Experiments**

My Time-Aware A* implementation achieved excellent results on all test cases for Question 2. To validate the algorithm's effectiveness, I compared it against an earlier "old algorithm" version, which had the flawed g_score logic, on the representative instance level_1/test_5.

**Performance Comparison of Old vs. New Algorithm on Q2 level_1/test_5**

| Algorithm Version         | Agents Completed   | Expanded Nodes | Sum of Costs (SIC) | Makespan |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| Old Algorithm             | 6 / 12 (50%)       | 2549           | 57                 | 212      |
| **New Algorithm (Final)** | **12 / 12 (100%)** | **411**        | **63**             | **34**   |

**Experimental Result Analysis**:  
As shown in the table, the new algorithm achieved a decisive performance improvement compared to the old version without the g_score optimization. On the level_1/test_5 instance, the new algorithm's **agent completion rate increased from 50% to 100%**. More importantly, its **search efficiency (expanded nodes) improved by over 80%**, and the quality of the paths found was significantly higher (makespan dropped dramatically from 212 to 34).

**Table 2: Final Performance Summary of the New Algorithm on all 56 Test Cases for Q2**  
This table summarizes the performance of my final algorithm across a selection of test cases.

| Test case      | Total agents | Agents done | DDLs met | Plan Time    | SIC        | Makespan  | Penalty | Final SIC  | P Score  |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- | -------- |
| level_6/test_5 | 150          | 150         | 150      | 85.42        | 28756      | 381       | 0       | 28756      | 191      |
| level_6/test_6 | 150          | 150         | 150      | 65.01        | 26127      | 407       | 0       | 26127      | 174      |
| level_6/test_7 | 150          | 150         | 150      | 53.31        | 25512      | 309       | 0       | 25512      | 170      |
| **summary**    | **2832**     | **2800**    | **2800** | **17(mins)** | **491433** | **11886** | **0**   | **491433** | **6776** |

The final **summary** row reveals that out of a total of 2832 agents across all 56 instances, my final algorithm **successfully completed 2800, achieving a completion rate of 99.58%**. Furthermore, all completed agents arrived at their destinations on time. This provides strong evidence that the chosen prioritized planning strategy, along with the key technical optimizations (especially the handling of g_score), is extremely effective and robust. The algorithm maintains a very low total path cost and planning time while ensuring a high success rate, successfully meeting the requirements of Question 2.

### **4. Question 3: Challenge - Dynamic Multi-Agent Coordinated Planning**

Question 3 represents the most difficult and comprehensive part of this challenge. It requires the **simultaneous** planning of paths for all agents in a dynamic environment, handling random runtime **malfunctions**, and minimizing a total cost that includes both path costs and **delay penalties**. This demands an algorithm that excels in coordination, efficiency, and robustness.

#### **4.1 Approach Evolution & Reflections**

To tackle this challenge, my solution underwent an iterative evolution process, progressing from a simple to a complex strategy.

**4.1.1 Initial Approach: Prioritized Planning with Random Retries**

My first attempt was to extend the prioritized planning algorithm that proved successful in Question 2.

- **Approach Description**:
    
    1. Instead of being called sequentially by the server, a main loop is implemented within the get_path function.
        
    2. First, an initial priority ordering for all agents is established based on a heuristic (such as Manhattan distance or deadline).
        
    3. The Time-Aware A* from Question 2 is then called sequentially for each agent according to this order.
        
    4. If, after this planning pass, any agent fails to find a path, the current solution is **completely discarded**. The priorities of all agents are then **fully randomized**, and the entire process starts over.
        
    5. This "random retry" process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 5 times) or until a solution is found where all agents are successful.
        
- **Advantages**: This is the most direct way to implement global planning, and the retry mechanism can, to some extent, overcome the issue of "false negatives" caused by a poor initial ordering in prioritized planning.
    
- **Reflections & Bottleneck Analysis**:
    
    - **Performance Bottleneck**: Experiments quickly revealed severe flaws in this approach. On high-density, tightly-coupled instances like level3_test_7, the **planning time increased dramatically** to unacceptable levels (over 300 seconds).
        
    - **Root Cause of Failure**: The fundamental issue is that when a low-priority agent gets "stuck" due to excessive constraints, its A* search descends into a **state-space explosion**, attempting to explore a massive number of near-impossible paths. This not only leads to **timeouts** but also to **Memory Limit Exceeded** errors, as A* needs to store all visited states (g_score and came_from). Random retries cannot solve this underlying problem; they merely repeat the same expensive and futile search process.
        

**4.1.2 Final Approach: Hybrid Strategy with "Plan B" Fallback**

To overcome the fragility of the initial approach, I designed a smarter, more engineering-driven hybrid framework. The core idea is to **acknowledge the limitations of any single search strategy and create a dynamic balance between high-quality planning and guaranteed feasibility through a multi-stage, fused mechanism.**

The centerpiece of this framework is the transformation of the low-level single-agent planner, plan_single_agent_path, into a two-stage hybrid solver:

1. **Stage 1 (Plan A): High-Quality A* Search**
    
    - **Objective**: To find the optimal path whenever possible.
        
    - **Mechanism**: The function first attempts to find a path using our optimized Time-Aware A* algorithm. To prevent it from running out of control, I implemented a **"circuit breaker"** in the form of a **node generation limit (NODE_LIMIT = 40,000)**. This limit directly controls the time and memory consumption of a single search.
        
2. **Stage 2 (Plan B): Fast Greedy Search Fallback**
    
    - **Objective**: To find any path to the goal, avoiding a score of zero.
        
    - **Mechanism**: If A* fails, either because it hits the NODE_LIMIT or genuinely cannot find a path, the function **does not give up immediately**. It instantly switches to a high-speed **Greedy Best-First Search**. This search's evaluation function f(n) is solely based on the heuristic h(n), ignoring the accumulated cost g(n). It can find a path to the goal with a very high probability and at great speed, at the cost of path quality.
        

This hybrid strategy ensures that the algorithm produces high-quality solutions on simple instances while avoiding crashes and ensuring a high agent completion rate on extremely difficult instances through its "cut-your-losses" and "fallback" mechanisms.

**4.1.3 replan Function Strategy**

For the replan function, which must respond quickly during execution, running a complex planning process is not feasible. Therefore, my replan function adopts a simplified but high-speed **Deadline-Prioritized Planning** strategy. It sorts the agents that need replanning based on their deadline and then calls our optimized, fused plan_single_agent_path function to rapidly generate new paths for them, ensuring a fast and effective response to dynamic malfunctions.

**4.1.4 Pseudo-code for plan_single_agent_path**
```python
function Hybrid_Single_Agent_Planner(start, goal, constraints, limits):
    // STAGE 1: Attempt A* with limits
    a_star_path = A_Star_Search(start, goal, constraints, limits.node_limit)
    
    if a_star_path is not failure:
        return a_star_path // Success with high-quality path
    
    // STAGE 2: Fallback to Greedy Search
    // A* failed, try to find ANY path quickly
    greedy_path = Greedy_Best_First_Search(start, goal, constraints)
    
    return greedy_path // Return greedy path (even if suboptimal) or failure
```

#### **4.2 Algorithmic Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: As this is a heuristic framework, a strict complexity analysis is difficult. The complexity of a single A* or greedy search is bounded by the NODE_LIMIT, and can be considered O(L), where L is the node limit. The high-level prioritized planning has a complexity of O(N * L log L), where N is the number of agents. With retries, the total complexity is O(R * N * L log L), where R is the number of retries.
    
- **Space Complexity**: O(N * L), primarily determined by the storage of g_score and came_from during each single-agent search, the size of which is also effectively controlled by NODE_LIMIT.
    
- **Completeness**: **Incomplete**. Both prioritized planning and greedy search are incomplete. While the retry and Plan B fallback mechanisms **greatly increase** the practical probability of finding a solution, it is theoretically possible for all attempts to fail.
    
- **Optimality**: **Not optimal**. Prioritized planning is inherently non-optimal. Furthermore, when the algorithm falls back to greedy search, path quality is further sacrificed. The objective of this algorithm is to find a high-quality, feasible, suboptimal solution within a finite time, not the global optimum.
    

#### **4.3 Reflections**

- **Advantages**:
    
    1. **Extremely Robust**: The circuit breaker and fallback mechanism allow it to handle instances of all difficulty levels gracefully, preventing the entire system from crashing due to a few difficult agents and thus guaranteeing a baseline score.
        
    2. **Balanced Performance**: On simple instances, its performance is equivalent to a high-quality A*. On difficult instances, it degrades gracefully to ensure task completion.
        
    3. **Highly Effective**: Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy achieves an excellent overall performance in terms of completion rate, on-time arrivals, and total cost.
        
- **Disadvantages**:
    
    1. **Inconsistent Path Quality**: For agents that trigger "Plan B," the quality of their paths can be poor, leading to delays.
        
    2. **Parameter Dependent**: The value of NODE_LIMIT is an empirical parameter that requires tuning. Set too high, it fails to act as a circuit breaker; set too low, and the algorithm will rely too heavily on the lower-quality greedy search.
        
    3. **Not Theoretically Optimal**: For scenarios that require a theoretically optimal solution, algorithms like CBS are still the better choice. However, for a competition with strict resource limits, this strategy is a more pragmatic option.

**Experimental Result Analysis**:
The final summary data shows that my algorithm successfully completed the task for 84% of agents to arrive on time out of a total of 2832 agents, which fully demonstrates the robustness of the fused and fallback mechanism. Although in high-difficulty instances such as level_5/test_1, the planning time was longer and there were still some agents who failed or were delayed, this is already an excellent performance that can be achieved under the prioritized planning framework. For example, in level_4/test_7, even if 3 agents failed, 47 were successfully completed, avoiding the disastrous consequence of getting 0 points for the entire instance due to timeout.  
Compared with the earlier version without a loss-stop mechanism (which took more than 300 seconds on level3_test_7), the total planning time of the final algorithm was controlled within a reasonable range. This proves that the "elastic loss-stop" strategy is crucial for ensuring the stability of the program and the effectiveness of scoring when faced with complex problems.

### **5. Conclusion**

This Flatland Challenge was an invaluable experience, transitioning from theory to practice. By solving three problems of increasing difficulty, I gained a deep understanding of the evolution from single-agent search to complex multi-agent coordinated planning. The final hybrid solver designed for Question 3, featuring an "A/B Plan Fallback" mechanism, represents an effective attempt to balance theoretical algorithmic completeness with engineering pragmatism in a competitive environment. It acknowledges the limitations of a single algorithm and, by introducing a circuit breaker and a fast backup plan, constructs a robust system capable of maximizing scores under strict resource constraints. The experimental results prove that this approach is a successful solution, achieving a high completion rate while balancing solving efficiency and path quality.
